⚠️ **This configuration is no longer maintained as I no longer own the hardware.**

⚠️ **This configuration may not be compatible with macOS Catalina and above.**

⚠️ **The included kexts and Clover bootloader *will* be outdated. Make sure to update to the latest available version.**

## System Specifications
Tested with macOS Mojave

- **Motherboard:** MSI Z97 PC MATE
  * Networking: RealtekRTL8111
  * Audio Codec: Realtek ALC887
  
- **CPU:** Intel i5-4690K @ 3.5GHz

- **GPU:** ASUS STRIX AMD Radeon R9 390
  > Disable the **connectors kext patch** if you're having issues with graphics. The connectors are patched for ASUS STRIX cards and may not work correctly with other brands.

## Known Issues

- Using DisplayPort can cause issues with video output, such as no signal.
  > Workaround: Use an alternative connection, such as HDMI.
 
- "Sleeping" for a long time can cause system instability upon wake.
  > Workaround: Increase the length of time required until entering sleep in System Preferences.

## Fix Blurry Font Rendering (10.14+)

Starting with Mojave, subpixel anti-aliasing is no longer supported on macOS, causing text on displays that are "non-retina" to look blurry. Enter this command in a terminal window to fix.

`defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO`
